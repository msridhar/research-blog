I plan to use this space to write about various research-y topics: my own (typically collaborative) work, other work I find cool, and useful open-source tools.  Inspired by blogs like [Embedded in Academia](http://blog.regehr.org/), [Existential Type](http://existentialtype.wordpress.com/), [Inside 206-105](http://blog.ezyang.com/), and [The PL Enthusiast](http://www.pl-enthusiast.net/), I hope to write posts that help disseminate research results more broadly or perhaps generate an interesting discussion.  I plan to tinker a bit more with the blog formatting and features as time allows.  I don't have a commenting system for now, but if you have feedback feel free to [get in touch](http://manu.sridharan.net).  Oh, and for those who are curious, this blog was built using the insanely fast [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com/) engine.  Thanks for reading!
