I'm happy to announce that I'll be the organizing chair for [TAPAS
2016](http://staticanalysis.org/tapas2016/), the Seventh Workshop on
Tools for Automatic Program Analysis.  As always, TAPAS is co-located
with [SAS](http://staticanalysis.org/sas2016/), which itself is
co-located with [PPDP and
LOPSTR](http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/ppdp-lopstr-sas-2016/) this
year.  The events will take place in the wonderful city of
[Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh) in September.  At
TAPAS, we (myself and the rest of the [organizing
committee](http://staticanalysis.org/tapas2016/#organizers)) are
aiming for an exciting set of talks on designing and implementing
practical program analyses and putting them to use in real-world
scenarios.  We have been fortunate to already line up an amazing set
of [invited speakers](http://staticanalysis.org/tapas2016/#invited),
and we will select further talks based on submitted abstracts.  The
submission site is not yet up, and it is still early, but consider
this post a bit of early publicity.  If you're not planning to be in
Edinburgh in early September, time to change your plans!
